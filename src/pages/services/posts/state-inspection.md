## What is Maryland State Inspection?

A Maryland State Inspection is a mandatory safety inspection that is required by the state of Maryland to ensure that vehicles on the road meet specific safety and emissions standards. The inspection is required for most vehicles before they can be registered or sold in the state.

During the inspection, a licensed inspector will examine the vehicle's braking system, steering and suspension components, tires and wheels, lighting and electrical systems, mirrors and windshield, fuel system, exhaust system, and emissions control system. The inspection is designed to ensure that the vehicle is safe to operate on Maryland roads and highways and that it meets specific emissions standards.

The Maryland State Inspection is necessary to ensure the safety of all drivers and passengers on the road. By identifying potential safety and emissions issues, the inspection helps to prevent accidents and protect the environment. Additionally, having a valid inspection certificate is required to register a vehicle in the state of Maryland.

It is important to note that passing the Maryland State Inspection does not guarantee that a vehicle is free from all mechanical issues or that it will continue to operate safely for an extended period of time. Regular maintenance and repairs are still necessary to keep a vehicle in good condition and operating safely on the road.

If you are a vehicle owner in Maryland, it is important to stay up-to-date with your state inspection requirements and to have your vehicle inspected by a licensed inspector as required. This will help to ensure that your vehicle is safe to operate on Maryland roads and highways and that you are in compliance with state regulations.
