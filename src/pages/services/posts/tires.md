## What is Tire Repairs?

Tire repair is the process of fixing a damaged or punctured tire so that it can continue to be used safely. Tire damage can occur from a variety of causes, including road hazards, curb damage, and general wear and tear.

When a tire is damaged, it can become unsafe to drive on and can also cause damage to other parts of the vehicle. Some common types of tire damage include punctures, cuts, and sidewall damage.

Tire repair typically involves inspecting the tire for damage and determining whether it can be repaired or needs to be replaced. If the tire can be repaired, the damaged area is cleaned and a patch or plug is inserted to seal the hole and prevent air from escaping.

## Why do I need to repair it?

It is important to repair tire damage promptly to ensure the safe operation of the vehicle. Driving on a damaged tire can be dangerous, as it can cause the tire to fail, resulting in a loss of control of the vehicle. In addition, driving on a damaged tire can also cause damage to the wheel and suspension components of the vehicle.

Regular tire maintenance, such as checking tire pressure and inspecting tires for damage, can help prevent tire damage and prolong the life of your tires. If you suspect that your tire is damaged or punctured, it is important to have it inspected by a professional and repaired if necessary.
