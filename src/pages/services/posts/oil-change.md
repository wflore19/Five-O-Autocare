## What is Oil Change?

An oil change is a routine maintenance procedure that involves draining the old engine oil from a vehicle and replacing it with fresh oil. The oil change process typically includes replacing the oil filter as well.

The engine oil plays a crucial role in the operation of the engine, as it lubricates the moving parts and helps to reduce friction and wear. Over time, the oil can become contaminated with dirt and debris, which can reduce its effectiveness and potentially cause engine damage.

Regular oil changes help to remove the old, contaminated oil and replace it with fresh, clean oil, which can help to prolong the life of the engine and improve its performance. Failure to perform regular oil changes can lead to engine damage, reduced fuel efficiency, and other problems.

The frequency of oil changes depends on the make and model of the vehicle, as well as the driving conditions. In general, it is recommended to have the oil changed every 3,000 to 5,000 miles or every 3 to 6 months, whichever comes first. However, some newer vehicles may have longer intervals between oil changes.

## Why do I need to repair it?

Regular oil changes are an important part of vehicle maintenance and can help to ensure the longevity and reliable operation of your vehicle.
