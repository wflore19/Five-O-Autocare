## What is Brake Repairs?

Brake repair refers to the maintenance and repair of a vehicle's braking system, which is responsible for slowing down and stopping the vehicle. The braking system is composed of several components, including the brake pads, brake rotors or drums, brake calipers, and brake lines.

Over time, the components of the braking system can become worn out, damaged, or corroded, resulting in decreased braking performance, squeaking or grinding noises, or a soft brake pedal. If left unaddressed, brake problems can result in decreased safety and potentially dangerous driving situations.

Brake repairs are necessary to ensure that the braking system is functioning properly and that the vehicle can safely stop when needed. The type of brake repair needed will depend on the specific problem with the braking system. Repairs may include replacing worn brake pads or rotors, fixing brake fluid leaks, or repairing or replacing the brake calipers or lines.

## Why do I need to repair it?

Regular brake inspections and maintenance can help prevent more significant brake problems in the future. Brake inspections can help identify potential issues before they become major problems, and regular brake maintenance, such as replacing brake pads and fluid, can help prolong the life of the braking system.
