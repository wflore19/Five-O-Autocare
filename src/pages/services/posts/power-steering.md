## What is Power Steering?

Power steering is a system in a vehicle that helps the driver steer the vehicle more easily by providing hydraulic or electric assistance to the steering mechanism. The power steering system typically includes a power steering pump, steering gear or rack, hoses, and various sensors.

Power steering is important because it makes it easier to steer the vehicle, especially at low speeds and when making tight turns. Without power steering, steering the vehicle would require much more effort and could cause driver fatigue.

Over time, the components of the power steering system can wear out or become damaged, which can cause a variety of problems. Common power steering problems include leaks, worn or damaged hoses, a failing power steering pump, or a malfunctioning steering gear or rack.

## Why do I need to repair it?

It is important to repair power steering problems promptly to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the vehicle. Driving with a malfunctioning power steering system can be dangerous, as it can make it difficult to steer the vehicle, especially in emergency situations. Regular maintenance, such as power steering fluid changes and inspections of hoses and other components, can help prevent power steering problems and ensure the longevity and reliable operation of your vehicle.
