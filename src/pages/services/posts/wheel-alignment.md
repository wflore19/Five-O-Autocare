## What is Wheel Alignment?

A wheel alignment is the adjustment of the suspension system of a vehicle to ensure that the wheels are aligned properly with each other and with the road surface. The purpose of a wheel alignment is to improve vehicle handling, reduce tire wear, and ensure that the vehicle drives straight and true.

Over time, the suspension system of a vehicle can become misaligned due to normal wear and tear, hitting potholes or curbs, or other factors. Misaligned wheels can cause a variety of problems, including uneven tire wear, poor handling, and decreased fuel efficiency.

During a wheel alignment, the technician will use special equipment to measure and adjust the angles of the wheels to ensure that they are in proper alignment. This may involve adjusting the camber, caster, and toe angles of the wheels.

## Why do I need to repair it?

It is important to have a wheel alignment performed regularly to ensure the safe and efficient operation of your vehicle. Driving with misaligned wheels can cause unnecessary wear and tear on your tires, suspension system, and other components, which can lead to costly repairs in the future.

Most vehicle manufacturers recommend having a wheel alignment performed every 10,000 miles or once per year, whichever comes first. However, it may be necessary to have a wheel alignment performed more frequently if you frequently drive on rough roads or have recently hit a pothole or curb.
