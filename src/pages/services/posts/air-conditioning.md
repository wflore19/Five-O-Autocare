## What is Air Conditioning System?

A car air conditioning system is designed to cool and dehumidify the air inside a vehicle to provide a comfortable and pleasant driving experience. The system works by compressing and circulating refrigerant through a closed loop system, which removes heat and moisture from the air passing over the evaporator and blows cooled air into the passenger compartment.

Over time, the components of the air conditioning system can become worn out or damaged, resulting in decreased cooling performance, strange noises, or unpleasant odors. If left unaddressed, air conditioning problems can result in decreased comfort while driving and potentially dangerous driving situations.

Air conditioning repairs are necessary to ensure that the system is functioning properly and providing optimal cooling performance. The type of air conditioning repair needed will depend on the specific problem with the system. Repairs may include replacing a faulty compressor, repairing leaks in the refrigerant lines, or replacing worn-out components such as the condenser or evaporator.

## Why do I need to repair it?

Regular air conditioning maintenance, such as cleaning or replacing the cabin air filter and having the refrigerant level checked, can help prevent more significant air conditioning problems in the future. It is recommended to have the air conditioning system inspected and serviced annually to ensure optimal performance.
